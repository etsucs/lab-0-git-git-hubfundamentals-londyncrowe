GitHub-cloud repository (is a Version Control System-VCS)

VCS--------------------------------------------------------------
•	Helps manage files/directories
•	Tracks changes
•	Recall previous version
•	Source Control subset of VCS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Git-operation to access cloud repository system
•	Created by Linus Torvalds
•	Replaced BitKeeper to manage Linux Kernel changes
•	Command line version control program
•	Use checksum to verify data integrity
•	Cross-platform
•	Open-source and free
•	Most companies use

Git Distributed Version Control (DVC)
•	Doesn’t need internet connection
•	No central server
•	No single point failure
•	Developers work independently
•	Every copy can be client/server
•	History of changes

Repository--------------------------------------------------
•	Used to organize a project
•	Can have folders, files, images, anything

Branching-Break off of features/ideas from main branch, gets merged back eventually if kept (imagine a splitting timeline from a show/movie)
Best to make a development branch off main so as few pulls/pushes to main as possible
Commit-adds/edits/deletes use commits to add to branch
•	Keeps track of progress and acts as a history of the work
•	Best to work in small segments to allow rollback of changes in needed

Pull Request- Discussion about commits

Merge and Deploy
•	After pull request reviewed and branch passes test, deploy changes for production
•	If branch causes issues, rollback with existing main branch

GitHub-hosts git repos
